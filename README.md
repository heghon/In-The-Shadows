# In-The-Shadows
A project from school 42. In this project I'm supposed to make a game.

In this project, I will develop a game close to Shadowmatic. Here is the goal of this game: the player must use an object in the foreground to create a shadow that looks like a familiar shape in the background. Visit the gameâ€™s website to get a clearer understanding:
http://www.shadowmatic.com/

The aim of this project is to make you implement a simple game from A to Z using a game engine (the choice is free).
The game design is not too complex, but it requires a little creativity.

The following tutorial for Unity is made early 2022, so this may not be up to dates.

In order for you to test this game, you should first install Unity hub. Link here : https://unity.com/download.

Ater this is done, you need to connect to your account (to create one : https://id.unity.com/en/conversations/3229727c-8c61-45ce-bbb1-df6819bab6ea007f), and you also need to activate a license if it's not already done (link here for help : https://unity3d.com/fr/unity/activation/personal).

The next step is to download a unity version in order to launch the project. I used the version 2020.3.17f1 for this particular project.
If you download another version, it could lead to errors when opening the project.

When the version is installed, you can open the project. In the file tab, you can click on "build and run". Choose a path to save the application and hit Enter.
Of course it depends of your OS but if needed you can download other build supports to build the project (help if needed : https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStartedAddingEditorComponents.html)


Have fun ! 
(Also, there is a little easter egg in there, can you find it ?)
